# Advent of Code 2024 Attempts in OCaml

Sporadic attempts to solve Advent of Code 2024 in OCaml.

You can run the code from the top directory as follows:

```
dune exec aoc_2024_day1
```
where you can change `day1` appropriately. The inputs must be placed
in the `inputs/` folder named as:

```
inputs/day1.txt

```
